A little script to return the number of days and weeks between a specified date range.

I got tired of looking at a calendar to count the number of weeks I would be available for
internships.

This will tell you the number of days and weeks between two dates

Run the script in your shell

1. 'python calendar_count.py'
2. Input your start date and end date (as prompted) in MM/DD format and the script will do the rest.
