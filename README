A little script to return the number of days and weeks between a specified date range.

I got tired of looking at a calendar to count the number of weeks I would be available for
internships.

Input your start date and end date (as prompted) in MM/DD [/YYYY] format and I will do the rest.
If you do not input a year, assume current year.
